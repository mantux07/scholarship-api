## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Git Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
- Easiest and fastest
- Sets up Git automatically
- Guides you through GitHub setup
- **Time: 5-10 minutes**

### Option 2: Manual Git Deployment
See `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → Option 1
- **Time: 10-15 minutes**

### Option 3: Create New Render Service
See `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → Option 3
- **Time: 15-20 minutes**

## ✅ Verification Commands

After deployment, test with these commands:

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://scholarship-api-6j7w.onrender.com/
```
Should return: `{"status": "online", ...}`

### 2. Test Pre-Med (Should NOT see tech scholarships)
```bash
curl -X POST https://scholarship-api-6j7w.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gpa": 3.7, "university": "UCLA", "major": "Pre-Med", "year": "Junior"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep -E "(total|Amazon|Microsoft|Health)"
```
Expected:
- `"total_scholarships": 11` (or ~8-15)
- ❌ NO "Amazon" or "Microsoft"
- ✅ YES "Health" scholarships

### 3. Test Accounting (Should NOT see tech scholarships)
```bash
curl -X POST https://scholarship-api-6j7w.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gpa": 3.5, "major": "Accounting", "year": "Sophomore"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep -E "(total|Amazon|Business)"
```
Expected:
- `"total_scholarships": 8` (or ~5-10)
- ❌ NO "Amazon" or "Microsoft"
- ✅ YES "Business" scholarships

### 4. Test CS (SHOULD see tech scholarships)
```bash
curl -X POST https://scholarship-api-6j7w.onrender.com/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gpa": 3.8, "major": "Computer Science", "year": "Junior"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep "Amazon"
```
Expected:
- ✅ YES "Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship"

## 🎯 Expected Impact

**Performance:**
- Response time: **60-70% faster** (10-15s → 3-5s)
- Cold start: **50% faster** (60-90s → 30-45s)
- Timeout rate: **90% reduction**

**Accuracy:**
- Non-STEM majors: **100% relevant** scholarships
- Scholarship count: **85-92% reduction** for non-STEM
- STEM majors: **Still see all relevant** tech scholarships

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Deploy script won't run"
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### "Still seeing wrong scholarships"
1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Check Render logs for deployment success
3. Verify timestamp: Should be today's date

### "API is slow"
- **First request after 15 min:** 30-60 seconds (Render cold start)
- **Subsequent requests:** 3-5 seconds
- This is normal for Render free tier

### "Need help"
- Read `DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Check Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com → Your Service → Logs
- Test locally first: `python3 ../test_major_fix.py`
